# Go-Back-N

The purpose of this project is to complement your existing Reliable UDP (RUDP) stop-and-wait protocol with a go-back-N protocol. As we have learned, stop-and-wait is horribly slow to transmit lots of data, especially as latency and loss in the network increases. The previous assignment shows this slow file transfer speed on the lossy network.


Task 1 - Implement go-back-N protocol


Task 2 - Add simple congestion control
